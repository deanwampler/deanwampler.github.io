<p><a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021667.do" target="fpjava">Functional Programming for Java Developers: A Short Introduction</a> explains the principles of <span class="keyword">Functional Programming</span> in a straightforward and pragmatic style, with code examples written in Java so the Java developer can see how to apply those ideas without switching to a functional language.</p>

<p>As a short introduction, the book doesn't cover every aspect of this rich field, but it tries to convey the most important ideas and why <span class="keyword">Functional Programming</span> is often a better fit than <span class="keyword">Object-Oriented Programming</span> for the problems of our time.</p>

<p>I cite these factors in the book for why I need <span class="keyword">Functional Programming</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>I Have to Be Good at Writing Concurrent Programs:</b> All of us must know how to write robust code that scales <em>horizontally</em>.</li>
<li><b>Most Programs Are Just Data Management Problems:</b> <b>Big data</b> requires very efficient management of resources. Those efficiencies also benefit "small data" projects. Over-reliance on object-relational mapping and other forms of object middleware lead to code bloat, poor performance, and lower agility. We should remember, <em>What's the simplest thing that could possibly work?</em> We shouldn't assume that our domain object models need to be faithfully implemented in code.</li>
<li><b>Functional Programming Is More Modular:</b> <span class="keyword">Functional Programming</span> moves the abstraction layers lower, to core data structures and <em>combinator</em> functions. The modularity and reusability of functional code is better than similar object-oriented code. Because objects are so free to expose abstractions any way they want, they are less reusable and composable, which is a paradox.</li>
<li><b>I Have to Work Faster and Faster:</b> <span class="keyword">Functional Programming</span> keeps my code concise, by minimizing unnecessary and "one-off" implementation constructs, and it keeps my code logically correct. These qualities, in turn, keep me more agile over the life of the project as requirements change and features evolve.</li>
<li><b>Functional Programming Is a Return to Simplicity:</b> <span class="keyword">Functional Programming</span> isn't <em>simple</em>, but it represents a return to <em>simplicity</em>; the goal of minimizing implementation size and complexity by rethinking our ideas about design patterns and idioms.</li>
</ul>
