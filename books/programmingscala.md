<p><em>Programming Scala, Third Edition</em> covers Scala 3. It will be published in June, 2021. You can read &ldquo;early access release&rdquo; chapters now on the <a href="https://oreil.ly/programming-scala-3">O'Reilly online learning platform</a>.</p>

<p>You can also pre-order ebooks and print copies at these book stores:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Scalability-Functional-Objects/dp/1492077895/ref=sr_1_1">Amazon</a> (Kindle version coming soon)</li>

<p>See my <a href="https://medium.com/scala-3">blog series about Scala 3</a>, where I summarize the highlights of what's new.</p>

<p>I also created this <a href="../scala3-highlights.html">synopsis of Scala 3 changes</a>, which I used as notes for several talks on Scala 3, such as the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/chicagoscala/events/274110140/">November 20, 2020 meeting of the Chicago Area Scala Enthusiasts.</a></p>

<h3>Why Programming Scala?</h3>

<p><a href="https://oreil.ly/programming-scala-3" target="book">Programming Scala, Third Edition</a> is a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to <a href="https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/" target="scala">Scala 3</a>. It is written for experienced developers new to Scala, as well experienced Scala developers migrating to Scala 3.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples" target="code">repo for the book's code examples</a> is Apache-licensed open source. If you want the examples for the second edition, focused on Scala 2, see the <a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples/releases/tag/2.1.0">v2.1.0 release tag</a>, which closely follows the organization of the second edition of the book, but it has been updated for Scala 2.12 and 2.13. The <a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples/">current <code>master</code> branch</a> only supports Scala 3.</p>

<p>I wrote the Scala book I would want to read, if I were starting from the following background:
    <ul>
        <li>I'm an experienced, <em>professional</em> developer building enterprise applications or I'm a data scientist who needs to work with a Scala-based infrastructure.</li>
        <li>I know how to program already. I have experience with Java, Python, or other languages.</li>
        <li>I know Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but not necessarily Functional Programming (FP).</li>
        <li>I want to get better at FP, while still leveraging my OOP skills.</li>
        <li>I'm serious about learning Scala.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>I would read <a href="https://oreil.ly/programming-scala-3" target="book">Programming Scala, Third Edition</a> to achieve the following goals:
    <ul>
        <li>Learn the common idioms, libraries, tools, and techniques used by experts building production software in Scala.</li>
        <li>Understand the major features of Scala and how to use them effectively.</li>
        <li>Understand why Scala is the language of choice for <em>data engineering</em> work in Big Data environments with tools like <a href="https://spark.apache.org" target="spark">Spark</a> and <a href="https://kafka.apache.org" target="kafka">Kafka</a>.</li>
        <li>Learn why Scala is an excellent language for state of the art microservice- and cloud-based production systems.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>My goal for the reader is to <em>really</em> know the language, including how features work, the design challenges and coding problems they were introduced to solve. I want you to learn the common techniques used to solve various design problems, as well as general best practices and idioms. There are some more obscure topics that I omit and some advanced topics that I only briefly mention, but you should be expert in Scala when you finish this book.</p>

<p>To discuss the book, the code examples, etc. use one of the following forums. Bug reports (and patches!) are especially welcome:</p>

  <li>The GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples/discussions" target="github">Discussions forum</a></li>
