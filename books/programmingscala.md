<p><em>Programming Scala, Third Edition</em> covers Scala 3. It will be published early in 2021, around the time that Scala 3.0 is finalized. You can read &ldquo;early access release&rdquo; chapters now on the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-scala-3rd/9781492077886/">O'Reilly online learning platform</a>.</p>

<p>I've also started a <a href="https://medium.com/scala-3">blog series about Scala 3</a>, where I summarize the highlights of what's new.</p>

<p>You can also find this <a href="../scala3-highlights.html">synopsis of Scala 3 changes</a>, which I used as notes for several talks on Scala 3, such as the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/chicagoscala/events/274110140/">November 20, 2020 meeting of the Chicago Area Scala Enthusiasts.</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples" target="code">repo for the book's code examples</a> is now updated for the third edition and Scala 3. However, the second edition code is available in the <a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples/releases/tag/2.1.0">v2.1.0 release</a>. That release still closely follows the organization of the second edition of the book, but it has also been updated for Scala 2.12 and 2.13. The <a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples/">current <code>master</code> branch</a> only supports Scala 3.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do" target="book">Programming Scala</a> is a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to <a href="https://scala-lang.org" target="scala">Scala</a>. It is aimed squarely at beginning Scala programmers or experienced Scala programmers migrating to Scala 3.</p>

<p>All three editions of this book are the books on Scala that I would want to read, if I were to start from the following background:
<ul>
<li>I'm an experienced, <em>professional</em> developer building enterprise applications or I'm a data scientist who needs to work with a Scala-based infrastructure.</li>
<li>I know how to program already. I have experience with Java, Python, or other languages.</li>
<li>I know Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), but not necessarily Functional Programming (FP).</li>
<li>I want to get better at FP, while still leveraging my OOP skills.</li>
<li>I'm serious about learning Scala.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>I would read <a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do" target="book">Programming Scala</a> to achieve the following:
<ul>
<li>Learn why Scala has become the language of choice for <em>data engineering</em> work in Big Data environments with tools like <a href="https://spark.apache.org" target="spark">Spark</a> and <a href="https://kafka.apache.org" target="kafka">Kafka</a>.</li>
<li>Learn why Scala is an excellent language for state of the art microservices and other non-trivial systems.</li>
<li>Learn the common idioms, libraries, tools, and techniques used by experts.</li>
<li>Master all the major features of Scala, warts and all.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>My goal for the reader is to <em>really</em> know the language, including the common techniques used to solve various design problems, as well as general best practices and idioms. There are some more obscure topics that I omit and some advanced topics that I only briefly mention, but you should be expert in Scala when you finish the book.</p>

<p>For more information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The code examples:

      <li><a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples/">Third edition, Scala 3</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples/releases/tag/2.1.0" target="code">Second edition, but upgraded to Scala 2.11-2.13</a></li>
    </ul></li>
