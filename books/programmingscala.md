<p><b>Update:</b> I've started work on the third edition, which will be published late 2020 and focus on Scala 3. The <a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples" target="code">code examples repo</a> is now a work-in-progress towards the new edition, but the second edition code was recently upgraded to work with Scala 2.12 and 2.13. Grab the <a href="https://github.com/deanwampler/programming-scala-book-code-examples/releases/tag/2.1.0">v2.1.0 tagged release</a> for the code that still closely follows the organization of the second edition of the book.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do" target="book">Programming Scala, Second Edition</a> is a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to <a href="https://scala-lang.org" target="scala">Scala</a>. It covers the features of Scala version 2.11 (although the code examples are compatible with Scala 2.12 and 2.13).</p>

<p>I wrote the book on Scala that I would want to read, if I were to start from the following background:
<ul>
<li>I'm an experienced developer of Enterprise or Internet, server-side applications.</li>
<li>I know Java and perhaps a few other languages.</li>
<li>I know Object-Oriented Programming, but not necessarily Functional Programming.</li>
<li>I hear that Functional Programming is the "future" and Scala is a natural migration step from Java.</li>
<li>I'm serious about learning Scala.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I would read <a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do" target="book">Programming Scala, Second Edition</a> to achieve the following:
<ul>
<li>Learn why Scala has become the language of choice for <em>data engineering</em> work in Big Data environments with tools like <a href="https://spark.apache.org" target="spark">Spark</a> and <a href="https://kafka.apache.org" target="kafka">Kafka</a>.</li>
<li>Learn why Scala is an excellent language for state of the art microservices.</li>
<li>Learn the common idioms, libraries, tools, and techniques used by experts.</li>
<li>Master all the major features of Scala, warts and all.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>There are some more obscure topics that I omit and other very advanced topics that I briefly mention, so you'll be aware of them. Still, my goal for the reader is to <em>really</em> know the language, the common techniques used to solve various design problems, and to understand how Scala is used in domains like <em>Big Data</em>.</p>
