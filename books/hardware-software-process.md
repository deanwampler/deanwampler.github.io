    <a href="https://derwen.ai/paco">Paco Nathan</a> and I wrote a report for NVIDIA entitled <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/resources/hardware-software-process-book/" target="nvidia">Hardware &gt; Software &gt; Process</a>. Based on recent conference talks Paco has given, it explores how the changing landscape of data science and the need to leverage hardware acceleration, especially GPUs, means we need to rethink how we structure software and software processes to maximize performance.
