    <a href="https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023555.do" target="book">Programming Hive</a> teaches you how to use <a href="https://hive.apache.org" target="hive">Hive</a>, the SQL query tool for Hadoop, and why it's important. I believe that Hadoop wouldn't be nearly as popular as it is without a SQL query tool, because so many data analysts know SQL and want to use it. Indeed, there are now many SQL options for Hadoop, addressing various performance, convenience, and usage goals.
