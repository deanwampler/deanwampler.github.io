My passion is landscapes, including time lapses, astrophotography, and macrophotography. I occasionally dabble in product photography, too. Send inquiries via <a href="mailto:info@deanwampler.photo">email</a> or message me on one of the apps below.

See <a href="https://medium.com/the-backpacking-photographer/move-shoot-move-for-astrophotography-f740bb4a49dc" target="_msm_blog">my blog post on MSM</a> for more details. I now use the newer <a href="https://www.moveshootmove.com/products/nomad-star-tracker-for-novice-and-experienced-astrophotographers" target="msm">Move Shoot Move NOMAD</a> tracker, which is a much better device.
