Landscape photography has been a growing passion of mine for a long time. This website's <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deanwampler/15905693911/in/album-72157649110558517/" target="_flickr">background image is from Colorado</a>. More recently, I've explored time lapses, plus macro and product photography.

My photos can be found at these websites:
* <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/deanwampler/" target="_flickr">Flickr</a>
* <a href="https://vero.co/bucktrends/" target="_vero">Vero</a>
* <a href="https://glass.photo/bucktrends" target="_glass">Glass</a>

Occasionally, I post to a <a href="https://medium.com/the-backpacking-photographer" target="_blog">photo blog on lightweight backpacking and photography</a>.

A few other pages here:
