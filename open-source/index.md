I started several open-source projects, including the following:

* [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/deanwampler/command-line-arguments): Yet another Scala library for parsing command-line arguments.
* [Aquarium](https://github.com/Agilefreaks/Aquarium): An [Aspect-Oriented Programming](https://aspectprogramming.com) toolkit for [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/): [home page](aquarium/index.html), [Rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/gems/aquarium).  _[Agile Freaks](https://github.com/Agilefreaks) recently took over ownership and maintenance of Aquarium._
* [Contract4J](contract4j): An AspectJ-based, [Design by Contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) tool for Java 5+, written in
[AspectJ](https://eclipse.org/aspectj/).
* [Stampede](https://github.com/deanwampler/stampede): A flyweight work flow scheduling tool, written as a reaction to bloated, hard-to-use tools like [Oozie](https://oozie.apache.org). It relies on classic <span class="keyword">UNIX</span> tools, like [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

Other projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/deanwampler).
